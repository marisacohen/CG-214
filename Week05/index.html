    <h1>Solace: An Interactive Film</h1>
        <!--this isn't the official audio of Solace, but I feel that it has a similar sci-fi almost under-water feel to it-->
        <audio controls autoplay>

        </audio>

        <p>"Based on a short story by Jeff Noon, this interactive short tells a dark tale of a near-future in witch marketing, DNA and addiction are disturbingly intertwined." This project was very interesting to me, because as an animator, I dream of telling stories visually, but I also love the idea of being able to do that while gettint people involved in the story, and this project really does this in an interesting way.</p>

                <li>The simple shape animations</li>
                <li>its child-like nature</li>
                <li>the ablity to interact with the story</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>click to pop bubbles</li>
                        <li>drag bubbles around screen</li>
                        <li>drag colors together to mix them</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>how the visuals went along with the audio, but indirectly</li>
                <li>the under-water soundscape</li>
            </ul>
