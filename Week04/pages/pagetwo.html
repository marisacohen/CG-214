        <p>I did a bit of reaserch on the Soalce project, and one of their early influences was this short by Chuck Jones. They were inspired by the way he was able to show story and emotion using only these simple shapes, that fall in love, and a strong spoken background audio to tell the story.</p>

        <p>this is another bit of inspiration for the creators of Solace. They liked the style of audio and its level of interactivity, and aspired to make something similar to this.</p>
