        <p>This was probably my favorite show when I was about 9, because it was one of the only cartoons of that time that just about a family, doing relatable things. It was also one of the few shows with female lead characters. I remember relating to the main character a lot (so much so that I had the oh so bright idea to try cutting my own hair like the main character...my parents like to remind me of that one)</p>

        <p>My favorite action drama cartoon, that I am currently in the process of buying each and every DVD for, so I can watch this show...since it's really not on the air anymore, and I legitimately miss it. The animation on this show is beautiful, and even more than that, the character development is amazing. Characters grow up and change and learn from their mistakes in a way that most cartoons never do. I respect this show so much for that.</p>

        <p>Sadly I never heard about this show until long after it was off the air, and long after I was the target audience age for a show like this, but I still think it is amazing. It is a little-known show from Canada about 6 teenages working at at the mall. The characters are like nothing I have seen from other cartoon shows, and its probably the only cartoon I have watched that truly seems appropriate for teenagers to love. Its silly, its relatable, and it covers things NO other cartoon I’ve seen before was willing to talk about. Things like getting your period or starting to date one of your best friends and how hard that really is. Even what happens when two friends are forced to become step siblings. </p>

        <p>This theme song is the one I used to sing, non stop until I was actually IN junior high I believe. I loved this show because, again, it was one of the few with a female lead, but better than that, it was a female lead who wasn not girly. I loved that Pepper Ann was a zany tomboy, and I remember looking up to  her for being so wild and crazy.</p>

        <p>I discovered this anime when I was in high school and fell in love. It was a lot of adult humor but still has the comedy of a younger cartoon mixed in. The characters are all lovable and unpredictable, but with real depth, despite some of the ridiculous messes they get themselves into. As an artist, I must say, this is one of the most beautiful shows I have ever watched. Even the theme song had some really incredible art in it.</p>

        <p>The show I would think of first as a kid, was Pokemon. It was THE show I would record on tape (wow that is an old fashioned sentence) whenever I had the chance, so I could rewatch episodes whenever I wanted. It collected the trading cards, the books, anything I could get my 7 year old hands on. This show was both realistic and fanciful with creatures that I wished were real. It was a great escape for me.</p>

        <p>A new show I fell for this year, that I had to add to my list of favorites, because it's the most charming cartoon I have seen in a very long time. It manages to be funny while also trying to teach kids lessons, which is something I feel has not been done well since the early 2000s. This show is sweet and energetic all at once.</p>

        <p>A somewhat unusual choice, since this show is a largely forgotten disney show from the mid 2000s. I liked that the tone of this show was so different. It was this interesting blend of Urban New York and full  blown Fantasy. The main character was a skateboarder with a crush on a girl, pretty normal, but he was also a dragon (meaning he could shapeshift from  human to dragon whenever he wanted, but as a dragon, he had a lot of responsibilities) this show, despite it's sort of strange premise, was actually very relatable for tweens I think, just done in a way that’s a little bit unorthodox. This show is in no way my favorite, but I do think a lot of my story telling style, rubbed off from watching so much of this show.</p>
