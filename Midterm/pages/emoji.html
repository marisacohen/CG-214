<!--a quick description about what inspired this page-->
<p>I am known as a very quiet person, but my face I am told is quite loud. I like to joke that I am often the unwitting mime in the room, facially reacting to everything without making a sound. I am oddly very proud of this, and I turned myself into a series of personalized emoji faces to show off that side of myself.</p>
    
  <p> Hover over each face to see one of my many expressions. </p>
    
 </div>   
    
<!--each div leads to a different emotion, even though they appear as the same blank expression. When you hover over each blank emoji face, you'll see a different expression. This was the best way I could think to do this.-->
