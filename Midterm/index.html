<p>As an illustrator and an animator, I tend to express myself mostly through my work, and I like it that way. I would much rather draw pictures of myself then let someone take a picture of me. Some might say this is an attribute of the shy, but I say, that my self portraits, tell you a lot more about me than any photo could. This, is my favorite self portrait, drawn in pretty much the same style I do most of my art in, but this is far from the only way I can draw myself, and probably the least telling. </p>
